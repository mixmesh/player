  Vulnerable solution:

    * P = <nym, PK, m, H(nym|PK|m)>
    * <Em(1), Em(P)>

    nym    = Pseudonym
    PK     = Ephemeral public key to be used to send a reply
    Em()   = Multiplicative Elgamal encryption function
    m      = Plaintext message
    H()    = Hash function

  Ideal solution:

    * P = <nym, PK, m, HMAC(nym|PK|m, K)>
    * <Em(1), Em(P), Ea(0), Ea(P)>

    Ea()   = Additive Elgamal encryption function
    K      = HMAC key
    HMAC() = Keyed-hash message authentication code

    K is hidden in Ea(0) and Ea(P) and can be extracated by
    calculating the discrete logarithm.

  Silly solution:

    * P = <nym, PK, m, HMAC(nym|PK|m, K)>
    * <Em(1), Em(P), K>

    Send K in cleartext until I find a fast solution to solve the
    discrete logarithm.

  Vulnerable solution for MVP:
    * P = <m>
    * <Em(1), Em(P)>
    
    Just encrypt a naked message using multiplicative Elgamal
    encryption, i.e. P does not include a nym, PK and a HMAC based on
    K.
